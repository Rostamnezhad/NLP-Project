# NLP-Project
NLP project in university last semester of under graduate

My friends and I did this project in a group of 3 members

In this project in phase 1:

1. we had a dataset and we did a preprocessing on this dataset (I will call it new_ds)
   
3. we used logistic regression on the new_ds
   
5. then we did the validation, test, train on new_ds with order of 20,20,60
   
7. in last step we calculate the (accuracy, precision, recall, score1f) on the project

in phase 2 : 

1. we build a neural network with tensorflow

in phase 3 : 

we compared results of the 2 phases
